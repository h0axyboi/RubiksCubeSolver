# RubiksCubeSolver
The program takes any configuration of a 3x3 rubiks cube as input and systematically prints the algorithm to solve it
It follows a five step layer-by-layer method using standard cube notations to represent how it wants to solve the cube.
The program has a constant time complexity because it regards all possible configurations equivalent and works on it.
